Hi, I'm Xander. I'm a member of the technical staff at the [UK AI Security Institute](http://aisi.gov.uk/), where I lead the Safeguard Analysis team, which uses adversarial ML techniques to understand, attack, and mitigate frontier AI safeguards. I'm also a PhD student at the University of Oxford, supervised by Dr. Yarin Gal. I previously studied computer science at Harvard, where I founded and led the [Harvard AI Safety Team](https://harvardaist.org). I enjoy writing, chess, listening to music, [and](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a9ItWvJHRpqune1srF5lVXOg2osX_imA/view?usp=sharing) [playing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPIZnW3uex4eCUomlKBqNMdyqf958JVi/view?usp=sharing) [piano](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRXvsDpkhYVeTdmUOT2_Lwfewkui3c_0/view?usp=sharing)[.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_RGtxt5Vn9Ob8-DvfG3AxNICyObTnwqf/view?usp=sharing) If you'd like to discuss any of this, feel free to email me at alexanderlaserdavies [at] yahoo [dot] com.
