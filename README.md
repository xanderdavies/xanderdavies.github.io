Hi, I'm Xander. I'm going into my fourth year at Harvard, where I study computer science. I lead the [Harvard AI Safety Team](harvardaist.org), and currently do deep learning theory research with [David Krueger](https://www.davidscottkrueger.com/)'s lab at Cambridge University. I'm interested in making sure advanced AI is developed safely. I also enjoy music, writing, and chess. If you'd like to discuss any of this, feel free to email me at alexander_davies [at] college [dot] edu.
